## Insurance API (Express.js)

This project provides a simple insurance policy API built with **Express.js**. It exposes endpoints for managing policies and retrieving associated product information. Data is stored in memory from JSON files located in the `src/data` folder.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run build
$ npm run start:prod
```

### Configuration

The server reads two environment variables:

- `PORT` ‚Äì Port to listen on (defaults to `3000`)
- `API_KEY` ‚Äì Key required for write operations

You can set them in your shell or by creating a `.env` file before starting the server.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/policies/:id` | Get a policy by ID with product details |
| GET    | `/policies?customerName=<name>` | Get all policies by customer name |

### Protected Endpoints (Requires `x-api-key`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
